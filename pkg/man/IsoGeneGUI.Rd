\description{
The IsoGene Graphical User Interface (IsoGene-GUI) is a user friendly interface of the IsoGene package which is aimed to identify for genes with a monotonic trend in the expression levels with respect to the increasing doses using several test statistics: global likelihood ratio test (E2), Bartholomew 1961, Barlow et al. 1972 and Robertson et al. 1988), Williams (1971, 1972), Marcus (1976), the M (Hu et al. 2005) and the modified M (Lin et al. 2007). 

The p-values of the global likelihood ratio test (E2) are obtained using the exact distribution and permutation. The other four test statistics are obtained using permutation . 

Several p-values adjustment are provided:  Bonferroni, Holm (1979), Hochberg (1988), and Sidak procedures for controlling the family-wise Type I error rate (FWER), and BH (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) and BY (Benjamini and Yekutieli 2001) procedures are used for controlling the FDR.
